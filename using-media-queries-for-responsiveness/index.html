      <p>The drastic (and inevitable) change in our economy leads me to understand the need for computer programming skills. Since computers can perform repetitive jobs more efficient than any human it is necessary for human labor to switch from menial monotonous labor to more creative and problem solving oriented labor. I believe computer programming is a useful skill that allows us to use our creativity to solve real world problems.</p>

      <p>I am a chemical engineer major looking to transfer to the University of Arizona. As Chemical Engineering greatly deals with scaling up the production of a product, I look forward to learning and analyzing the significant role computers play in the marketing and production process. As a future engineer I see myself managing and making production decisions of a company. My current dream is to work for Tesla (of course). Though I look forward to understanding the engineerâ€™s importance in developing and maintaining essential computer software in any production process.</p>

      <p>While my goals are specific here, I look forward to working for any company that provides a beneficial products and/or service to its clients. .</p>
